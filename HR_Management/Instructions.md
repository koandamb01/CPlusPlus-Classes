/*You are tasked to build a (HR) Management Program that allows a company to manage its employees. 
This project will help you practice structs, arrays, vectors, and functions together in one real-world style program.

Functionalities:
1. Employee Information
Each employee should be represented using a struct Employee with the following fields:
- int id (unique employee ID)
- string fullName
- int age
- string ethnicity
- string position
- double salary

2. Main Functionalities
Your program should provide a menu with the following options:
1. Add a new employee
2. Update an employeeâ€™s information (find by ID, then update)
3. Remove an employee (find by ID, then delete from the list)
4. Find an employee by ID (display all their details)
5. Get Reports
6. Exit Program

3. Reports
When the user chooses Get Reports, show another menu with the following options:
- Get number of employees
- Get the oldest employee info
- Get the youngest employee info
- Get the highest paid employee info
- Get the least paid employee info

4. Bonus:
- Get percentage of employees by ethnicity
- Get the average salary of all employees

Requirements
- Use a struct for employees
- Use an array to store employees (with a max size of 20)
- using a vector (easier to add/remove employees)
- Use functions for each feature (e.g., addEmployee(), findEmployee(), removeEmployee(), etc.)*/
